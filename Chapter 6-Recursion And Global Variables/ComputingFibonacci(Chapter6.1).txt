#When the implementation of fib in Figure 6-3 is
used to compute fib(5), how many times does it compute the value
of fib(2) on the way to computing fib(5)?

fib5 will call fib4 and fib3 , fib4 will call fib3 + fib2, fib3 will call fib2 + fib1
That means when we call fib5 it will compute the value of fib(2) 3 times. Two in fib4 call(one in when fib4 call fib3 + fib2 , other in when fib3 call fib2 + fib1), one in fib3 call.
