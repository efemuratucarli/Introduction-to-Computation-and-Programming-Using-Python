#Finger exercise: What is the value of the following expression?
#isinstance('ab', str) == isinstance(str, str)

isinstance function checks that whether its first argument is a instance of the second argument. If it is, it return true. Otherwise false.
isinstance('ab', str) 'ab' is a instance of a string type thus it will return true. isinstance(str, str) str denotes string type so it is not a instance of string 
type. It is a instance of type. Therefore "isinstance(str, str)" will return false. The whole expression isinstance('ab', str) == isinstance(str, str)
will become "true == false" because of that the value of isinstance('ab', str) == isinstance(str, str) is false. 
In other words isinstance('ab', str) == isinstance(str, str) will return False.
